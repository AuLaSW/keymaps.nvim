# Keymaps.nvim

A plugin for managing my key mappings.  I prefer to have all of 
my keys mappings in one location, so this makes it easier to work 
with them.  If you would like to use this, you can delete the 
keymaps and set up your own.  You have to call the function for 
each plugin in the file that the plugin is loaded from (or, if 
you aren't using Lazy.nvim, just load the functions however is 
needed by your plugin-manager).

## Future Updates

In the future, I would like to implement the following:

- [ ] Custom map loading through a setup function.
- [ ] Better ways to call the keymaps through lazy loading.
